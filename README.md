# Trade-and-Econometrics---Structural-Gravity-modelling-of-India-MEFTA-relations

This repository contains my work on General Equilibrium Impacts of the US-MEFTA via structural gravity modelling. The paper relies heavily on Herman's code on gegravity package developed for the specific purpose of analyzing general equilibrium impacts of trade liberalization on member and non-member countries, as well as developing a counterfactual scenario where some countries either leave or join the FTA.

# Gravity model and estimation of baseline

Anderson and Wincoop's gravity model (2003) was instrumental in changing the way economists looked at trade impacts of liberalization, as they introduced the Multilateral resistance terms which dictated a country's response to increase in trade costs not only with the partner country, but all other countries in the world. This solved the famous border puzzle and opened new gates of exploration of different trade agreements. Anderson and Yotov suggested the GEPPML procedure to estimate the baseline gravity model as well as the counterfactual scenario. 

# Herman's work 

Herman's GE Gravity package was developed with the specific purpose of using the GEPPML method to estimate the structural gravity equation. We have utilized it to estimate impacts of India and its top trading partners in the Middle East joining the already existing US-MEFTA agreement, as India gears towards improving trade relations wit hthe Middle East via the IMEC. Our results indicate that joining the US MEFTA would be a positive step for both India and all other partner countries' trades.
